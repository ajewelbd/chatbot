This rather is a picture of the different influences that have brought they this far.

Government Permission Received onApril 29, 2013
With Government permission received on April 29, 2013, and with hopes of beginning the University in a small way in 2014, it is worthwhile to understand how Holy Cross Fathers got to this point. This short write-up is not a detailed history of the events leading to the founding of the university. Fr. Adam Pereira, CSC, has assembled such an outline. This rather is a picture of the different influences that have brought they this far.
A talk of starting a University
Very early in the history of the educational ministry of Holy Cross Fathers in Bangladesh, there was a talk of starting a University. The Notre Dame College was then staffed almost exclusively by expatriate missionaries who came with advanced degrees in hand to teach. The College began in 1949 at the Intermediate level and in the years to the Liberation War (1971) was small in size and well-staffed with such missionaries.
After Independence
After Independence everything changed to Bengali-medium and almost all of the expatriates withdrew and there were only then a few local CSC priests called to do a variety of ministries. The College got down to 2 men full-time. Any thought of a university was long gone. There was concern to keep the college going.
The question of a university rose again on a variety of tracks
An outside evaluation of the College suggested it to be considered.
The Bishops of Bangladesh raised the issue – to have the Church present at this level and to witness in this way.
The alumni of Notre Dame College on several occasions strongly recommended to the Holy Cross Fathers a vertical expansion of  the institution of the university level.
The Government announced a new education policy, basically going over to the American system: Primary School: 1 to class 8;  High School: classes 9-12; College (Hons.): 4 year degree.
If this were implemented, the College (Notre Dame) would need to be changed completely. The present classes 11 and 12 would only be the last two years of high school. A fourth year would have to be added to the present three-year degree (pass) course. The College started planning how classes 9 and 10 could be added and what it would mean for the College to be a high school.
The Crucial Question
The crucial question was adding another year to the degree program. With the gaps in the system, the four years would take six or more years.The Holy Cross Fathers began to think that if they were able to start a private university, they could create their own syllabus, hold their own exams, confer their own degrees and do four years in four years.
When it became known
When it became known that Holy Cross Fathers were thinking again about it, a number of people came forward to encourage them: Education leaders, Community leaders, College Alumni, the Papal Nuncio (Archbishop Joseph Marino), Government people, the German Embassy, etc.The idea picked up impetus. They felt that, with help from Notre Dame College, the idea might be feasible. Maybe they would start small and let it grow. they became more optimistic.
Holy Cross Fathers soon realized
The Holy Cross Fathers soon realized what a complicated process was involved in making application to the University Grants Commission, securing in the University’s name land donated by the College, establishing the required reserve fund.The final application when fully completed is a book almost 6 inches thick.
We have finally received permission
We have finally received permission, secured the land, made a design for the University Building and are putting together the practical aspects of beginning, especially working out with the College the details of sharing space, finances, scheduling, etc.
The effort is underway
The effort is underway to seek the funding to build the University building, looking at both foreign and local benefactors.They have come this far and are determined and committed to go forward. They count on the blessings of God and the help of many interested supporters. Notre Dame University Bangladesh is a long-cherished dream coming true. There is still so much work ahead of them but they keep reminding themselves that “If there is a will, there is a way”. They, with the support and encouragement of many, have the will and are seeking the way.

Learn about the congregation of Holy Cross
Congregation of Holy Cross
The Congregation Holy Cross was founded by Blessed Basil Anthony Moreau in Le Mans, France, in 1837. In Latin the name of the group is Congregatio a Sancta Cruce (CSC).   The Congregation, composed of two Societies of religious priests and religious brothers, has more than 1200 members and is currently serving in sixteen countries on five continents.  Notre Dame University Bangladesh was established in 2014 by the Holy Cross Fathers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Province. The Congregation first came to serve in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1853. Since then the CSC priests, brothers and sisters have established primary schools, high schools, and colleges in  remote areas as well as in the cities and towns of this country. NDUB is the first Catholic university and the first Holy Cross institute of higher education to be established in Bangladesh.

We shall always place education side by side with instruction; the mind will not be cultivated at the expense of the heart. While we prepare useful citizens for society, we shall likewise do our utmost to prepare citizens for heaven.
Blessed Basile Moreau, CSC

Vice Chancellor, NDUB
Home > About > Leadership > Administration
Message from the Vice Chancellor
Notre Dame University Bangladesh was established quite recently, only in 2013, but the experience and the inspiration that brought it into existence have deeper roots in Bangladesh.  When Notre Dame College (for boys) and Holy Cross College (for girls) opened their doors almost seventy years ago, the Congregation of Holy Cross, which founded both of them in Dhaka, had already been teaching in the schools of East Bengal for over a hundred years.

Who are the Congregation of Holy Cross​
Congregation of Holy Cross
The Congregation Holy Cross was founded by Blessed Basil Anthony Moreau in Le Mans, France, in 1837. In Latin the name of the group is Congregatio a Sancta Cruce (CSC).  The Congregation, composed of two Societies of religious priests and religious brothers, has more than 1200 members and is currently serving in sixteen countries on five continents.  Notre Dame University Bangladesh was established in 2014 by the Holy Cross Fathers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Province. The Congregation first came to serve in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1853. Since then the CSC priests, brothers and sisters have established primary schools, high schools, and colleges in  remote areas as well as in the cities and towns of this country. NDUB is the first Catholic university and the first Holy Cross institute of higher education to be established in Bangladesh.

The Congregation of Holy Cross (Fathers, Brothers, and Sisters) has been involved in education here since its first arrival 161 years ago. The first Holy Cross religious to die here, in 1855, was a teacher, Brother Benedict Fitzpotrick, C.S.C. sent by Fr. Sorin from America to join the first group.The work of serving the scattered Christian community in this part of Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Arakan in Burma, always had education of the children as an integral part . Mission schools, at the primary and later at high school level, taken or established by the Holy Cross Brothers and Sisters, were open to all children of all religious faiths, a work which continues until today.In 1949 Notre Dame College for boys and in 1950 Holy Cross College for girls were opened in Dhaka. This brought Holy Cross education to the intermediate level, between high school and degree studies. The Holy Cross Brothers have three like colleges now, two in Dhaka, and one in Dinajpur. In this context significant interaction can be found among all religious faiths and traditions of Bangladesh.We are now responding to urging for many years and from many quarters to begin a university in this Holy Cross tradition of academic excellence, value education, discipline and formation.  Serious consideration has arisen in recent years. The Bangladesh Catholic Bishops’ Conference desired this, while many alumni of our schools, Moslem, Hindu, Buddhist and Christian urged us to establish such a university.We began to think it might be possible after looking at the present reality and considering all that would be required to begin a private university in a small way.  Many immediately came forward to help and to guide us. The Governing Body of Notre Dame College generously donated the necessary land at the south end of the campus, providing a significant part of the required reserve fund as a loan. The Holy Cross Fathers put up 400,000 dollars for this fund.  Organizational work was begun. Once the required application was submitted in detail to the government, permission was secured to begin. It was decided that the university would be co-educational, English-medium, value-based, service-oriented, student-centered.We hope to begin by September 2014 in temporary facilities until we can construct our own academic building.  Holy Cross Brothers and Sisters, with members of other Religious communities, are involved in the planning and organization, along with many from every faith, to help us inaugurate this project. We will look to a network of Holy Cross Colleges and universities throughout the world to enlarge our horizons.

Grading System
The total performance of a student in a given course is based on a scheme of continuous assessment made through a set of In-course/assignment(s) class attendance and participation and a Trimester Final Examination. The assessment in-sessional courses are made through observation of the students at work in classwork and viva-voce. A Letter Grade with a specified number of Grade Points is awarded in each course for which a student has registered. A student’s performance is measured by the number of credits that he/she has completed satisfactorily and the weighted average of the Grade Point is required to be maintained for satisfactory progress. Similarly, a minimum number of earned credits should be acquired in order to qualify for the Degree.

Management positions such as Sales Manager, Project Manager, Internship Manager, Business Manager, or Shift Manager become available. Along with those, people with bachelor’s degrees work in positions aimed at improving business operations. For example, a Business Operations Analyst studies a company efficiencies and recommends ways to improve it. Taking a job in accounting is also a path many choose.With an MBA, people qualify for numerous management and leadership roles. These may include jobs such as Business Manager, Senior Business Strategy, or Director of Business Analysis. Those with an MBA also go on to work in VP roles in positions like the VP of Business Development and VP of Strategic Operations, which consists of implementing plans to improve business processes. People who specialize in concentrations such as finance can go on to work in a role as a Financial Manager or Chief Financial Officer. These roles oversee the financial and investment activities of a company and make sure they achieve their financial goals and projections. Although most people who graduate with an MBA go on to the corporate world, a small number may go on to be community college Instructors or Adjunct Assistant Professors.Business administration majors typically work in offices or, in the case of those with a doctoral degree, in the classrooms of colleges and universities. While most two year colleges and four-year schools prefer individuals with doctoral degrees, some may hire individuals with MBAs as part-time instructors or teaching assistants.

Rules for doing majors in two streams
If a student of Batch 1 or Batch 2 decides to pursue a second major, they will be allowed to do so after they complete their internship program. However, if a student of a subsequent batch (Batch 3 or higher) wishes to pursue another major course, they will have to complete all the required academic courses before beginning their internship program.Those who have capacity to take 5 courses in each trimester, will be allowed to complete 10 (ten) courses of their Major stream in two trimesters. But those who would find 5 courses in each trimester too much, will take two courses in an extra trimester for their second major after completion of the requirements of the first major stream.This means, the students of third and the following Batches will have to decide about taking a second major before their internship program and then inform the Chairman of the Department. Only after completing all required courses—for both 1st & 2nd majors—they will they will be allowed to begin their internship program.
Rules of Internship or Thesis
Experience shows that most BBA students prefer to follow an internship program. However, if a student wants to do a thesis instead of an internship, they should proceed as follows: Students of 1st and 2nd Batches, seeking to do a thesis, will be allowed to do so, provided they have a satisfactory CGPA and the prior permission from their respective faculty supervisor.Students of Batches 3 and following will be allowed to take thesis only if they can secure CGPA 3.50 or above.
Rules for Teaching Assistance
The BBA graduates of NDUB who seek to enroll for the MBA program at NDUB will be allowed to apply for a Teaching Assistance only if they have a CGPA minimum of 3.80. However, they also have to appear before an interview board and present a demo class as part of the application process.

MEssage from the department head
Dr. Md. Azizur Rahman
Professor, Chairman, Department of Economics
Economics is very important as a subject. It belongs to Social  science faculty in some Universities  and in some other to science faculty. Adam  Smith is the Founder of Economics. In all famous Universities of the world including  MIT, Harvard  University ,Chicago university,Oxford University, Cambridge University and many  others  Economics is taught  with excellenc. What ever be the faculty , Economics is the mother of all sciences. That is why the Nobel  Foundation Committee  has chosen Economics as a subject for Nobel Prize. Consequently each year we are getting world famous Economist(s ) receiving Nobel Prize. The first  Nobel laureate Economists jointly were Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen in 1969. The first Nobel  laureate American Economist was Paul Samuelson in 1970 who was the Founder of  MIT graduate Department  of Economics.We are proud of two  Indian Economists  Professor Dr. Amartya Sen received Nobel Prize in 1998 and Prof  Dr. Abhijit Vinayak Banrjee received Nobel prize in 2019 .
. Economics is very important because all our life from cradle to grave and beyond we  have to run up against the brutal truths of Economics. Without studying Economics we cannot fully understand growth, Budget,  tax policy, fiscal policy, monetary policy, fluctuations,  inflation,deflation, unemployment, peak, recession, depression, recovery, full employment, trough, macroeconomic stability, cost- benefit analysis, impact of environment pollution and warming.
Regarding the special features of Economics Department of Notre Dame University Bangladesh I want to mention that the faculties of this  Department are very friendly , cooperative and devoted to students study.They take high care and give cordial attention to their students for their gradual and sustainable progress.They always motivate students about their unlimited latent potentialities. They allows follow the UNOSC message that a good teacher speaks not only chosen programs but  also the needs of the learners.
Participatory class lectures, assignments, quiz, group learning and sharing, group and individual presentations, asking and answering questions, conducting research, and writing research papers, etc.are techniques of the Department. Facuties always give intensive attention to slow learners and try to accelerate fast learners. They try to optimise individual learning outcomes by bridging students--students and students--teachers gaps.
The faculty members of the department have excellent academic records and research backgrounds. We have both permanent faculties and adjunct facilities. The adjunct facilities come from Dhaka University, Jahagirnagar University and Jagnnath university. I have been working as Professor and Chairman of the Department of Economics. We always welcome students in Department of Economics.
In final year , Economics  students have options either to do thesis or to do internships. Those who go for internships they have opportunities to do it with Bangladesh Bank, Sonali Bank, Janata Bank, Agrani Bank and other reputed public and private organisations. Those who do thesis get chance to do Ph.D at home and abroad after completing Masters degree. At present many of our first Batch students have been doing Ph.D. abroad and some ones doing jobs.

Rules for doing majors in two streams
If a student of Batch 1 or Batch 2 decides to pursue a second major, they will be allowed to do so after they complete their internship program. However, if a student of a subsequent batch (Batch 3 or higher) wishes to pursue another major course, they will have to complete all the required academic courses before beginning their internship program.Those who have capacity to take 5 courses in each trimester, will be allowed to complete 10 (ten) courses of their Major stream in two trimesters. But those who would find 5 courses in each trimester too much, will take two courses in an extra trimester for their second major after completion of the requirements of the first major stream.This means, the students of third and the following Batches will have to decide about taking a second major before their internship program and then inform the Chairman of the Department. Only after completing all required courses—for both 1st & 2nd majors—they will they will be allowed to begin their internship program.
Rules of Internship or Thesis
Experience shows that most BBA students prefer to follow an internship program. However, if a student wants to do a thesis instead of an internship, they should proceed as follows: Students of 1st and 2nd Batches, seeking to do a thesis, will be allowed to do so, provided they have a satisfactory CGPA and the prior permission from their respective faculty supervisor.Students of Batches 3 and following will be allowed to take thesis only if they can secure CGPA 3.50 or above.
Rules for Teaching Assistance
The BBA graduates of NDUB who seek to enroll for the MBA program at NDUB will be allowed to apply for a Teaching Assistance only if they have a CGPA minimum of 3.80. However, they also have to appear before an interview board and present a demo class as part of the application process.

Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident.

About the department
The Department of English, under the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, commenced its journey when Notre Dame University Bangladesh was granted permission to begin the academic session by the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh in December 2014.The Department currently offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses in English literature, language, linguistics, and ELT to hundreds of students. The course curriculum is designed to equip the students with the skills essential to pursue careers in the academic as well as the non-academic world. Its value-based and service-oriented curriculum features a wide variety of foundational and interdisciplinary courses along with its up to date core courses in English literature, language and ELT to help the students to contextualize their learning in relation to their historical and cultural realities. The unique blending of English literature and ELT core courses in B.A. (Honours) programme makes the graduates competent to pursue their higher studies in both English literature and ELT. Virtually all courses here require extensive and intensive reading, writing and presentation, along with active participation in the classroom discussion. The graduates possess skills in written and spoken communication, independent thought and judgment as well as critical thinking and research, all of which are highly valued by students as well as parents. Above all, the Department features a growing number of highly educated faculty members whose energetic, congenial, and cerebral presence makes the Department an excellent centre of literary creativity, and intellectual inquiry and discovery.The Department makes a continuing commitment to providing its students and faculty members with first-rate facilities, such as a multimedia language lab, a seminar and reading room, and online access to a well-stocked library.The Department is also committed to promoting discussion of contemporary literary/linguistic theory and practice and research in English literature and ELT. So students are encouraged to participate in departmental seminars, featuring speakers from within and outside the University.The Department runs NDUB English Club, which arranges a weekly reading circle, and public speaking session to foster students’ rhetoric and presentation skills. The Club’s reading circle focuses on sharpening students’ ability of critical thinking and analytic reasoning. From time to time, the Club also organizes seminars and workshops where the Department’s students play a vital role. The Club publishes magazines on the bimonthly and yearly basis. The Department’s students also have active participation in the Debating Club, Drama Club, Business Club, and the Cultural Club of the University.The Department of English offers following program:
Bachelor of Arts in English Language & Literature (ELL)

At Notre Dame University Bangladesh, the Department of English, established in 2014, enables students to evolve in critical thinking along with their proficiency in the English language. Moreover, with literature written in English, and in critical and creative writing, by prudently uniting breadth with depth and tradition with contemporaneity, students deepen their understanding of narratives and their context, through the lens of history, psychology, culture, linguistics and comparative literary texts. In addition, the Department aims at research and scholarship, independently or collaboratively, on aspects of literature and language and to publish the results of our work widely.
Objectives of the department
Objective
The Department provides a liberal education in the pedagogical realm where courses are designed to blend the ‘thinking arts’ with practical training. For instance, classrooms are well equipped with technical support so students learn about rhetoric, logic, and grammar, along with fiction, prose, poetry, drama, and literary theories. More specifically, we aim to graduate students who have:The reading skills to examine literature from multiple eras, cultures, and genres with critical understandingThe ability to express themselves clearly and comprehensively, orally and in writingResearch skills which enable them to expand, from a variety of perspectives, their own readings of literature and understanding of languageAn appropriate knowledge of relevant fields within the discipline, including literature; literary history, criticism, and theory; the language structures of modern English and the history of the English language
Specific Strategies
The specific strategies we use to achieve these goals include:The close reading of texts in lectures, seminar presentations, and small-group discussionsThe writing of analytical and other kinds of essaysCreative writingProfessional writingStudio classes in theatre/drama and video productionOn the other hand, club activities and academic centers like the English Language Centre, and performative aesthetics for staging of literary productions, and various seminars and workshops by contemporary academic veterans constructs a practical learning environment for our students.The department appreciates thesis writing at undergraduate level. Many students visit various sites and remote areas to conduct their research. Students who are doing the major in Literature or Linguistics, are supervised by efficient academics to do a lot of research works with the help of the well-equipped NDUB library. Students who do not pursue thesis writing, submit s term paper and a comprehensive exam of 100 marks.
Career Prospect
The broader prospect of English graduates is teaching, whether graduates are from the literature or linguistics stream. Bangladeshi schools, colleges, and universities need a wide range of faculty members for all English courses of all departments. However, graduates can also opt to be a researcher at various national and international research organizations, UN organizations (for instance, UNDP, UNICEF, UNESCO, ILO, and such).Secondly, most of the English graduates are seen to perform efficiently in the print and visual media. As the Mass Media sector requires aesthetics and language skills, here the English graduates are mostly preferred.Certainly, for any job, apart from technical skills, most important requirement is ‘Intelligence’ which means one’s capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, planning, creativity, problem solving, and eventually applying knowledge within an environment or context.Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man, says Francis Bacon. By reading global literature and language, one understands history, politics, culture, international relations, and human psychology. Thereby, English Language and Literature smoothly, in tune, incorporates other disciplines, which makes it stronger.Undoubtedly, this Department introduces such readings through which one can critically perform as a Statesperson who would have sound sense on the State policies in relation to culture, politics and the public psyche. In addition, to crack high score in BCS exam, one has to be proficient in English language.In the Banking sector, if officials, have read the theory of power and money in relation to society and civilization, to be specific: theories by Marx and Weber, one can value the role of banking in a different way in society. Here again, fair selection in a job means high score in the selection exam where English language plays a great role. And the best way to learn a language is by reading.Finally, entrepreneurship is one of the most creative sectors. To understand business, one has to understand how trends develop. Cultural, psychological, and literary theories would give a clear idea how a product or knowledge is produced and promoted, as well as consumed by the society that not only enhances the number of consumers but also creates a ‘taste’ for the products.Every job is a performance, and performance means: speech and gesture — both are the pillars of literary practice. Novelists communicate through their characters, poets through their verses, and political activists through their slogans. It is all about having strong communication skills, whatever the job area is. And the Department of English perfectly trains in that direction.

MEssage from the department head
Tahsin Khan
Asst. Professor, Chairman, Department of Law
The Department of Law started its journey in 2014 with the mission of providing students with a well-rounded legal education so that they can demonstrate their full legal potential and serve the community wherever they live and work.  We also emphasize on instilling moral and ethical values through the knowledge of law.
The Department at present runs two programs, namely, Bachelor of Laws (LL B Hons.) and Master of Laws (LL M). However, the academic study here in the department is about much more than just learning the letter of the law. The legal environment that we offer is quite different from the traditional learning environment. We encourage the students to adopt an innovative approach so that they can combine academic rigor with practical legal skills which is necessary to be successful in a real life environment.
Hope you will have a wonderful time with us!

Rules for doing majors in two streams
If a student of Batch 1 or Batch 2 decides to pursue a second major, they will be allowed to do so after they complete their internship program. However, if a student of a subsequent batch (Batch 3 or higher) wishes to pursue another major course, they will have to complete all the required academic courses before beginning their internship program.Those who have capacity to take 5 courses in each trimester, will be allowed to complete 10 (ten) courses of their Major stream in two trimesters. But those who would find 5 courses in each trimester too much, will take two courses in an extra trimester for their second major after completion of the requirements of the first major stream.This means, the students of third and the following Batches will have to decide about taking a second major before their internship program and then inform the Chairman of the Department. Only after completing all required courses—for both 1st & 2nd majors—they will they will be allowed to begin their internship program.
Rules of Internship or Thesis
Experience shows that most BBA students prefer to follow an internship program. However, if a student wants to do a thesis instead of an internship, they should proceed as follows: Students of 1st and 2nd Batches, seeking to do a thesis, will be allowed to do so, provided they have a satisfactory CGPA and the prior permission from their respective faculty supervisor.Students of Batches 3 and following will be allowed to take thesis only if they can secure CGPA 3.50 or above.
Rules for Teaching Assistance
The BBA graduates of NDUB who seek to enroll for the MBA program at NDUB will be allowed to apply for a Teaching Assistance only if they have a CGPA minimum of 3.80. However, they also have to appear before an interview board and present a demo class as part of the application process.

Grading System
Grading Scale

Course Repetition
Repeat/Retake Policy
Distribution of Marks
The distribution of marks for given courses will be as follows:
Mid-Term: 30 (duration: one and a half hours) Final: 40 (duration: 2 hours) Attendance: 10 (for 90% attendance) Quiz: 10 (minimum 2 quizzes) Assignment & Presentation: 10Pass Marks in the written part out of 70 is 28Pass Marks in the other 30 marks for attendance, quiz and assignment is 12
*Students have to obtain permission from the academic council to attend the final examination if their attendance and participation are less than 70% (due to legitimate/justifiable reasons).
The Grading System
The total performance of a student in a given course is based on a scheme of continuous assessment made through a set of In-course/assignment(s) class attendance and participation and a Trimester Final Examination. The assessment in sessional courses are made through observation of the student at work in classwork and viva-voce. A Letter Grade with a specified number of Grade Points is awarded in each course for which a student has registered. A student’s performance is measured by the number of credits that he/she has completed satisfactorily and the weighted average of the Grade Point is required to be maintained for satisfactory progress. Similarly, a minimum number of earned credits should be acquired in order to qualify for the Degree.
Grading Scale
Letter Grades and corresponding Grade Points will be awarded in accordance with the provisions shown below:

Thirty percent (30%) of marks shall be allotted to continuous assessment: class attendance, active participation in the class, assignment, presentation, and quizzes or class tests. The remaining marks will be allotted to Mid-Term and Trimester Final Examination – conducted centrally by the University. There may be two examiners for each course in the Trimester Final Examination.
Earned Credits
The courses in which a student obtains C or a higher grade will be counted as credits earned by him/her. If a student obtains D grade in any core course of any Trimester, he/she will have to repeat the course. In the case of D grade in an optional course, s/he may choose to take a substitute course, if available.
Regular Grading
D Grade will not be counted for Grade Point Average (GPA) calculation but will be shown on the Grade Sheet. When a student repeats a course in which s/he previously obtained D/F grade, s/he will be given just immediate lower grade that s/he obtained in the repeated course. But in case s/he obtains C grade, that will be maintained and this grade will be shown in the transcript. If a student has to repeat a course due to punishment on him/her, the grade obtained will be maintained. If a student obtains a grade other than D in a course, s/he will be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement.
Repetition of Course(s)
If a student repeats a course for which s/he obtained D/F grade (in any previous Trimester), s/he may be allowed to repeat the continuous assessment (i.e. Class Test/Assignment/Term paper) to improve the grade, but s/he has to apply to the Head of the Department through concerned course teacher within 20 working days from the beginning of the Trimester. However, the marks of class attendance and participation will be taken from the previous record.
Policy for repeating and retaking courses
Repeat: A student who receives an F grade in a course will repeat it and the grade received on repeating the course will replace his/her original grade (F). A student can repeat a course twice. To repeat courses students must first register with applicable fees
Retake: A student with a grade of B minus (B-) or below (not F grade) may retake courses for improvement of grade once; the best of the grades earned in a course on retaking will be counted for CGPA calculation. Registration with appropriate fees must be completed before retaking courses.

Rules for doing majors in two streams
If a student of Batch 1 or Batch 2 decides to pursue a second major, they will be allowed to do so after they complete their internship program. However, if a student of a subsequent batch (Batch 3 or higher) wishes to pursue another major course, they will have to complete all the required academic courses before beginning their internship program.Those who have capacity to take 5 courses in each trimester, will be allowed to complete 10 (ten) courses of their Major stream in two trimesters. But those who would find 5 courses in each trimester too much, will take two courses in an extra trimester for their second major after completion of the requirements of the first major stream.This means, the students of third and the following Batches will have to decide about taking a second major before their internship program and then inform the Chairman of the Department. Only after completing all required courses—for both 1st & 2nd majors—they will they will be allowed to begin their internship program.
Rules of Internship or Thesis
Experience shows that most BBA students prefer to follow an internship program. However, if a student wants to do a thesis instead of an internship, they should proceed as follows: Students of 1st and 2nd Batches, seeking to do a thesis, will be allowed to do so, provided they have a satisfactory CGPA and the prior permission from their respective faculty supervisor.Students of Batches 3 and following will be allowed to take thesis only if they can secure CGPA 3.50 or above.

Rules for doing majors in two streams
If a student of Batch 1 or Batch 2 decides to pursue a second major, they will be allowed to do so after they complete their internship program. However, if a student of a subsequent batch (Batch 3 or higher) wishes to pursue another major course, they will have to complete all the required academic courses before beginning their internship program.Those who have capacity to take 5 courses in each trimester, will be allowed to complete 10 (ten) courses of their Major stream in two trimesters. But those who would find 5 courses in each trimester too much, will take two courses in an extra trimester for their second major after completion of the requirements of the first major stream.This means, the students of third and the following Batches will have to decide about taking a second major before their internship program and then inform the Chairman of the Department. Only after completing all required courses—for both 1st & 2nd majors—they will they will be allowed to begin their internship program.
Rules of Internship or Thesis
After completion of 42 courses of 3-credit hours, every student undergoes an internship program of 3 months in any organization. After completion of the program, he/she submits an internship report under supervision of a faculty member.Students with CGPA 3.00 or more may be allowed to write a thesis having three credits, instead of an internship.
Rules for Teaching Assistance

Grading System
Grading Scale
Marks Distribution
Earned Credits
Regular Grading
Course Repetition
The Grading System
The total performance of a student in a given course is based on a scheme of continuous assessment made through a set of In-course/assignment(s) class attendance and participation and a Trimester Final Examination. The assessment in-sessional courses are made through observation of the student at work in classwork and viva-voce. A Letter Grade with a specified number of Grade Points is awarded in each course for which a student has registered. A student’s performance is measured by the number of credits that he/she has completed satisfactorily and the weighted average of the Grade Point is required to be maintained for satisfactory progress. Similarly, a minimum number of earned credits should be acquired in order to qualify for the Degree.
Grading Scale
Letter Grades and corresponding Grade Points will be awarded in accordance with the provisions shown below:

Forty percent (40%) of marks shall be allotted to continuous assessment: class attendance, active participation in the class, assignment, presentation, and quizzes or class tests. The remaining marks will be allotted to Mid-Term and Trimester Final Examination – conducted centrally by the University. There may be two examiners for each course in the Trimester Final Examination.
Distribution of Marks
The distribution of marks for given courses will be as follows:
Mid-Term: 30 (duration one and a half hours) Final: 40 (duration: 2 hours) Attendance: 10 (for 90% attendance) Quiz: 10 (minimum 2 quizzes) Assignment & Presentation: 10
Pass Marks in the written part out of 70 is 28
*Students have to obtain permission from the academic council to attend the final examination if their attendance and participation are less than 70% (due to legitimate/justifiable reasons).
Earned Credits
The courses in which a student obtains C or a higher grade will be counted as credits earned by him/her. If a student obtains D grade in any core course of any Trimester, he/she will have to repeat the course. In the case of D grade in an optional course, s/he may choose to take a substitute course, if available.
Regular Grading
D Grade will not be counted for Grade Point Average (GPA) calculation but will be shown on the Grade Sheet. When a student repeats a course in which s/he previously obtained D/F grade, s/he will be given just immediate lower grade that s/he obtained in the repeated course. But in case s/he obtains C grade, that will be maintained and this grade will be shown in the transcript. If a student has to repeat a course due to punishment on him/her, the grade obtained will be maintained. If a student obtains a grade other than D in a course, s/he will be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement.
Repetition of Course(s)
If a student repeats a course for which s/he obtained D/F grade (in any previous Trimester), s/he may be allowed to repeat the continuous assessment (i.e. Class Test/Assignment/Term paper) to improve the grade, but s/he has to apply to the Head of the Department through concerned course teacher within 20 working days from the beginning of the Trimester. However, the marks of class attendance and participation will be taken from the previous record.

Notre Dame University Bangladesh was established quite recently, only in 2013, but the experience and the inspiration that brought it into existence have deeper roots in Bangladesh.  When Notre Dame College (for boys) and Holy Cross College (for girls) opened their doors almost seventy years ago, the Congregation of Holy Cross, which founded both of them in Dhaka, had already been teaching in the schools of East Bengal for over a hundred years.
This Congregation began in France, which explains the name, since “Notre Dame” is French for “Our Lady,” referring to Mary the mother of Jesus.  From Europe it spread out to many parts of the world.  Wherever Holy Cross priests, brothers, and sisters went, they brought a love of learning as well as a devotion to patriotic service, to equitable sharing of the earth’s resources, and to seeking peace by practicing justice.

Holy Cross Congregation in Bangladesh has been imparting quality education and rendering moral formation to young learners most of whom achieve efficiency in different professions and stand out as committed citizens to serve the country with dedication. So this institution has enormous contribution to education at tertiary level.
The brand ‘Notre Dame’ is a symbol of excellence in education in Bangladesh and beyond. So Notre Dame University Bangladesh, I hope, will complement the government initiatives and offer life-oriented higher education to youngsters of all faiths equipping them with necessary skills and virtues in the true sense so that they become able to help materialize our vision.
Parents of university students expect that each tertiary level institute ensure quality education so that the future generation will get an environment where they will grow in developing all their faculties to the fullest.

Our teachers don’t just stick to what is on our syllabus. What they do is they discuss with us the current socio-political happenings around the world and this is what makes us socially and politically conscious, which I believe is really important for a young person in today's world.

NDUB is an educational institution where even an ordinary student gets inspired towards studies. The positive environment here brings out the best from the students and helps us grow in tune with the times. Here variety of extracurricular activities, seminars-workshops on the recent issues and colorful events are held on festive days, which ensures our positive mental growth.

Notre Dame is and will always be a particular part of my life. Now I am studying at Lakehead University, Canada, and missing life at NDUB a lot. Their education atmosphere, system, and administration are excellent to the students. This university always tries to take students' comments and work on them. The main thing I have gained from Notre Dame is that she always tries to make her students become better human beings.

We always find that there are a few students who are more capable; others are average caliber and a few who may be a bit slow in learning. A good teacher knows how to help pupils to get maximum benefit from their mentor and guide. NDUB values primacy of human person and, therefore, every student counts.The campus of Notre Dame University Bangladesh is meant to be a place where interaction among students, between students and faculty, and in near future among inter-university students and faculty members takes place. The present student-body by reflecting on their past tradition, analyzing the present reality, will create new knowledge for the future and discover the unknown. The silver or golden future they now dream of individually or as a group for their community and for the nation to be actualized through hard work and in-depth study as well as research.
The gospel values and the social teachings of the Church are the pillars of faith of the NDUB founding Fathers. The cardinal values of all religions and cultures are the same and they inspire and guide us. So, together we all are very determined to achieve our cherished goal to impart quality tertiary education to the present generation in our care. May God bless us all!
Fr. Patrick D. Gaffney, CSC
Vice-Chancellor
Notre Dame University Bangladesh was established quite recently, only in 2013, but the experience and the inspiration that brought it into existence have deeper roots in Bangladesh. When Notre Dame College (for boys) and Holy Cross College (for girls) opened their doors almost seventy years ago, the Congregation of Holy Cross, which founded both of them in Dhaka, had already been teaching in the schools of East Bengal for over a hundred years.This Congregation began in France, which explains the name, since “Notre Dame” is French for “Our Lady,” referring to Mary the mother of Jesus. From Europe it spread out to many parts of the world. Wherever Holy Cross priests, brothers, and sisters went, they brought a love of learning as well as a devotion to patriotic service, to equitable sharing of the earth’s resources, and to seeking peace by practicing justice.Our young university owes a great debt of gratitude to Fr. Benjamin Costa, CSC who has recently stepped down after guiding this institution with great care from its tender beginnings. We also recognize with humble appreciation the appointment of a new Vice Chancellor by the Honorable Abdul Hamid, President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. We understand that this approval of our efforts and our aspirations implies a large measure of responsibility. For our part, we eagerly accept this challenge. We who work at NDUB are committed to providing excellent academic training in every field, with an emphasis on moral integrity and social awareness while providing opportunities for personal growth in terms of both intellectual development and ethical perception.The core curriculum at NDUB, starting in the first year, includes courses that encourage wholesome self-discipline, critical thinking, and intellectual curiosity. At the start of their university studies all students receive an introduction to the liberal arts, which aim to enlighten the mind, to guide the heart, and to transform knowledge into wisdom. Since we are already well advanced into the twenty-first century, this includes a foundation course in computer science.The faculty members at NDUB are dedicated to the same goals as the students, although as teachers and scholars, they lead the way by bringing the old and the new together with a discerning eye. Our current facilities also reflect a combination of the past and the future. Plans for the construction of a beautiful modern high-rise campus have been completed and ground-breaking should occur before the end of 2017.NDUB draws upon a rich tradition of local engagement and international participation. A good education, like a true friendship always involves discovery and commitment. In this spirit, we attempt to stimulate a desire to explore and we seek to nurture the competence and conscience that come with higher learning. Working together, sharing our talents, and boldly facing present obstacles, we strive to find the right path forward and to follow it.

speech of club co-ordinator
Here's what our club coordinator has to say
Certainly, NDUB Club activities contributes a lot in the life of the students in the university. It is important part and partial of the student’s life of the university. It offers a different set of skills for the all-round development of a students. The unique curriculum helps students to acquire knowledge but extra-curricular activities helps to develop the inner potentiality of the hearts and minds of the students. Students who do the regular studies and engaged themselves with the creative energy through clubs I am sure they make changes in every sphere of life. It is because education is such drawing out the best from the life of the students. Students’ efforts on this helps to build their carrier for the future life. It is when students only realize that good results will not help them rather they need to develop their skills through learning.
Sr. Shagorica, CSC
Student Counselor & Club Co-Ordinator
Notre Dame University Bangladesh
Clubs can be the means to advance the wholesome development of their potentialities. The most important part is that students are taking part in the friendly competitions with the other universities. Right now Notre Dame University Bangladesh has offered an access to multiple clubs — they are:NDUB Dram and FilmNDUB English ClubNDUB Debate ClubNDUB Law ClubNDUB CSE ClubNDUB Business ClubNDUB Cultural ClubWe also have very competent moderator and co-moderators for these clubs. They are very dedicated. They promised themselves to create a students friendly atmosphere in NDUB campus through clubs. Different seminars, programs are organized by their spontaneous efforts. I believe clubs makes classroom learning easier and comfortable. Through participating in different clubs students learn how to be disciplined, respectful, work in a group, speak the truth, stand by the poor and oppressed, and prepare to be an efficient leader for the nation as well as for the global community.I feel honored to be a part of Notre Dame University Bangladesh and serve in my best role as club coordinator. I am here to support the students, teachers and NDUB family. It is my inner urge for the university community to build fine characters and live by ethics and values in life.I would like to thank all the moderators and co-moderators in different clubs for taking such responsibilities on their shoulder to make NDUB glorious though their tireless efforts. Thank you also all the executive members of each clubs and all the members who are making the whole.May our journey together in NDUB family bring supreme success for the young and mature learners of the university.

Objective
The time has changed, and it has made a very big difference in student life globally. With the changes over time, the society has changed greatly in the educational field along with Socio-Economic, academic and Cultural aspects. If we want to step forward as students and faculty with the new rhythm of life, we need to adjust and update ourselves according to the signs of the times. Therefore, we have appreciated the idea of forming NDUB LAW CLUB and formed it for better academic nourishment according to the signs of the times and the present needs of the society. It will teach its members to work for justice with the spirit of independence or freedom irrespective of caste, creed, religion or any particular region.

About NDUB Language Center
With a view to upgrading the students’ oral and written competency in English, the NDUB Language Center (NDUB LC) was inaugurated on January 24, 2019 by Brian O’Conchubhair, PhD, the then Director at Centre for the Study of Languages and Cultures (CSLC), Associate Professor of Irish Language and Literature, University of Notre Dame, Indiana (USA), Maggie Vosters, Assistant Director, CSLC, and Lisa Joy Oglesbee, Coordinator of English for Academic Purposes, CSLC.
Under the directive guidance of Fr Tom McDermott, CSC, Director, NDUB LC was founded to help their proficiency in the language. The center is a free space where all members of the Notre Dame community can access resources, expert help, and curriculums devoted to bettering their reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills.
NDUB LC aims at helping individuals naturally nurture their communicative skills in English. Located on the NDUB campus, the Language Center offers multiple opportunities and resources to improve their listening skills, reading books to increase their reading skills and uplift oral fluency in English. Since its inception, the NDUB LC has organized free interactive workshops, seminars, academic counseling, peer-tutoring, and arranged free learning sessions on fundamentals of writing, and facilitated a free listening lab for NDUB students.
NDUB LC is free and open for all on weekdays (Sunday – Thursdays) from 10 am till 4 pm. Any member of the NDUB community who wants to enhance their language proficiency in terms of listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English can either book an appointment or simply drop by the center for queries.
Fr. Tom McDermott, CSC
Director, Language Center
Message of the Director
I encourage all students of NDUB to take advantage of the facilities and personnel of our new NDUB Language Center. Join with your friends to discuss the issues of today in the international language of business and politics. Prepare yourselves for the needs of the future by strengthening your fluency in English and find the joys of exploring the wider worlds of literature and media and joining the struggles of diverse peoples for justice and peace. See you at the Center!
Our Services to student
What we provide to our students
Listening Lab
Aiming to help students enhance their listening skills, the NDUB LC Listening Lab provides audio content on a variety of genres, including sports, current affairs, animations, theater,  movies, art, culture, economics, trade and commerce, lifestyle, mental health, law and legislation, and entertainment, among others. With their multiple high-quality computers with headphones, the listening lab provides the visiting members with the best listening experience. Opting for a creative way in terms of linguistic input, the listeners can help upgrade their pronunciation and cohesion by simply acquiring the language in natural order rather than just memorizing grammatical structures.
Peer Tutoring
The peer tutoring program facilitated by the NDUB LC helps individuals to work through their weaknesses in English with the help of their peers (fellow students). The peer tutoring strategy involves language learners to serve each other as academic tutors and tutees. This method allows the English language learners to engage and interact with each other in the target language English. Working through with each other, the pair gradually picks up each other’s strengths and finds ways to get rid of their drawbacks.
IELTS Prep
NDUB LC offers free practice materials for individuals who are preparing for their IELTS examinations. Alongside materials, the center also facilitates consultancy for students and help them by providing feedback.
Panel Discussions
Conducted by skilled professors and experts, free workshops and seminars are organized by the NDUB LC once every 2 weeks. While the workshops are interactive and promote collaborative learning for the attendees, the seminars provide specific lectures on academic, social, political, and cultural themes. On the other hand, the panel discussions help students broaden their perception of topics. The students can register for these workshops at the NDUB LC during office hours.
One on One Counseling Sessions
NDUB LC is offering two types of counselling sessions at the moment: academic and career. While academic counselling focuses on helping a student get better in academics, the career counselling session helps them acquire soft skills and practical knowledge which prove to be assets in the job market.
Seminars and Workshops
Conducted by skilled professors and experts, free workshops and seminars are organized by the NDUB LC once every 2 weeks. While the workshops are interactive and promote collaborative learning for the attendees, the seminars provide specific lectures on academic, social, political, and cultural themes. On the other hand, the panel discussions help students broaden their perception of topics. The students can register for these workshops at the NDUB LC during office hours.
NDUB Language Center Library
The NDUB LC library offers a wide range of books on writing, research, and pedagogy. Excellent pieces of literature for the ones seeking reading for pleasure are also available here. It also has an online resource hub that enables the Notre Dame community to access free resources on their personal laptops, smartphones, and desktops. Students, teachers, and staff members of the institution can easily access these reading materials from the library upon visiting.
Short Courses
Designed specifically to meet individual needs, the short courses conducted by the NDUB LC offer 4-12 week courses on grammar, reading, writing, and spoken alongside literary topics. Interested individuals can drop by the NDUB LC to register for the offered courses free of cost, however, pre-registration is mandatory.
